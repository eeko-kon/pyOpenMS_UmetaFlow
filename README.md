#This is the progress of a pyOpenMS workflow to dereplicate untargeted metabo data 
#File to look at: Workflownew.py

## Link for the raw and converted data:

#Agilent files cannot run right now in pyopenms 
#raw data Thermo Orbitrap: *.raw files of standards Germicidins A (1 and 2 are the same - 1 is just higher concentration of the standard) and B. 
#mzml convert: MS1 and MS2 converted to centroid
#FileFiltered : all files have negative intensities (from Thermo) and had to be filtered through OpenMS to only keep positive ones.
